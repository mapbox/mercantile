Changes
=======

1.2.0 (2021-04-19)
------------------

- Copyright holder and date (Mapbox, 2021) have been updated.
- CLI help and documentation has been updated.

1.2b1 (2021-04-14)
------------------

There have been no changes since 1.2a1.

1.2a1 (2021-04-12)
------------------

Project infrastructure changes:

- Default GitHub branch is now "main".

Deprecations and future warnings:

- The Tile constructor in mercantile 2.0 will refuse to make tiles with X and Y
  indexes outside of the range 0 <= value <= 2 ** zoom. It will also require
  indexes to be integers.

New features:

- Add ``geojson_bounds`` to get the bounding box of a GeoJSON geometry,
  feature, or collection (#119).
- Add ``minmax`` to get minimum and maximum x and y tile coordinates.
- Add ``neighbors`` function and command to get adjacent tiles (#118).

1.1.6 (2020-08-24)
------------------

- In some cases tile() could return a Tile with float x or y attributes (#115).
  This is a new bug in 1.1.5 and breaks some user code on Python 2.7 and is now
  fixed.

1.1.5 (2020-06-16)
------------------

- A bug in ``simplify()`` has been fixed and the algorithm has been improved
  (#111).
- Implementation of ``tile()`` has been simplified and corrected (#114).

1.1.4 (2020-04-28)
------------------

- Change a list comprehension to a generator expression in simplify().
- Change DeprecationWarning introduced in 1.1.3 to a UserWarning to increase
  visibility.
- Ensure symmetric InvalidLatitudeErrors at both poles (#106).

1.1.3 (2020-04-13)
------------------

- Warn about deprecation of support when mercantile is imported with Python
  versions < 3. Mercantile 2.0 will not be compatible with Python 2.7.
- The bounding tile of the bounds of a tile is now that same tile (#100).

1.1.2 (2019-08-05)
------------------

- fid of 0 is now allowed by the ``feature()`` function (#85).
- Passing the bounds of a tile to ``tiles()`` now yields exactly that tile
  only (given the correct zoom), resolving #84 and #87.
- QuadKeyError derives from ValueError again, resolving issue #98, but only
  until version 2.0. A deprecation warning explaining this is raised from
  quadkey_to_tile just before QuadKeyError is raised.
- Format source using black.

1.1.1 (2019-07-01)
------------------

- Update tests to work with pytest 5.

1.1.0 (2019-06-21)
------------------

- A zoom keyword argument has been added to both ``children()`` and
  ``parent()``, allowing the user to specify the zoom level for each (#94).
- A new ``simplify()`` function merges child to parent tiles, upwards,
  producing the shortest sequence of tiles that cover the same space (#94).
- The mercantile module now raises only exceptions deriving from
  MercantileError. Such errors indicate improper usage of the mercantile
  module. The occurance of a builtin exception indicates a bug in mercantile.

1.0.4 (2018-06-04)
------------------

- Added missing docstrings (#80).

1.0.3 (2018-05-17)
------------------

- Support a single zoom value passed to ``tiles()`` as advertised (#78).

1.0.2 (2018-05-08)
------------------

- The ``xy`` function returns ``float(inf)`` and ``float(-inf)`` for y at the
  North and South pole, respectively, instead of raising an exception (#76).

1.0.1 (2018-02-15)
------------------

- Corrected an error in the ``bbox`` parameter description in the
  ``bounding_tile`` docstring (#73).
- Corrected an error in the geojson.io example in the CLI docs: the proper
  usage is ``mercantile shapes --collect`` (#71, #72).
- Add missing ``--version`` option to mercantile command.
- Python 3.6 has been added to the Travis build matrix.

1.0.0 (2017-12-01)
------------------

Thanks to all contributors (see AUTHORS.txt), users, and testers, Mercantile
1.0.0 is ready. Share and enjoy!

1.0b2 (2017-11-27)
------------------
- Add ``tiles`` to ``__all__`` and sort that list. This sorts the classes
  and functions in the API docs.

1.0b1 (2017-11-21)
------------------
- Documentation: overhauled API reference docs based on output of
  sphinx-apidoc.

1.0a1 (2017-11-16)
------------------
- New feature: the ``feature`` function returns a GeoJSON feature for a tile
  (#46).

0.11.0 (2017-10-17)
-------------------
- New feature: the ``lnglat`` function is the inverse of ``xy`` (#62).
- New feature: the --bounding-tile option of mercantile-tiles has been made
  into a new mercantile-bounding-tile command (#43).
- API change: the --bounding-tile and --with-bounds options of
  mercantile-tiles have been removed.

0.10.0 (2017-05-26)
-------------------
- API change: ``InvalidLatitudeError`` is raised by ``tile`` when Y cannot be
  computed.
- New feature: ``xy_bounds`` to get Spherical Mercator bounds for tile (#60).
- New feature: ``Bbox`` class with ``left``, ``bottom``, ``top``, ``right``
  properties (#60).
- Bug fix: prevent ``tiles`` from returning tiles with invalid indexes (#47).

0.9.0 (2016-05-20)
------------------
- Refactoring: new ``normalize_input`` and ``iter_lines`` functions for
  use in the CLI (#58).
- Refactoring: the coarse ``try/except`` blocks have been removed from within
  CLI subcommands, ``sys.exit`` calls are removed, and ``sys.stdout.write``
  calls have been replaced by ``click.echo`` (#58).
- Refactoring: many PEP 8 changes and new tests to bring the project to 100%
  coverage (#58).
- New feature: functions and subcommand for converting between tiles and
  quadkeys (#50, #51, #56, #57).
- Bug fix: correct output when a point is given to mercantile-tiles (#48, #49).
- Bug fix: more consistent interface for tile arguments (#53).

0.8.3 (2015-08-24)

  wrong value.
